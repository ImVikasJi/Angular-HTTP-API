To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. 
When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template binding, or interpolation,
Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values. If a value was already sanitized outside of Angular and is considered safe,
communicate this to Angular by marking the value as trusted.
Unlike values to be used for rendering, Angular templates are considered trusted by default,
and should be treated as executable code.
Never generate templates by concatenating user input and template syntax.
Doing this would enable attackers to inject arbitrary code into your application. 
To prevent these vulnerabilities, always use the default AOT template compiler in production deployments.
